 * @Mathias 
 * Your solution passes all tests which we had provided.
 * Additionally, you even wrote two test cases of your own. 
 * 
 * But watch out: I added some additional tests which will not pass with your current solution. 
 * 
 * Watch out for encapsulation:
 * The class variable String pattern is not used from outside, so you could make it private.
 * 
 * Watch out for naming:
 * 		return proof(String file, String pattern)
 * would be more readable/understandable if you use for example
 * 		return isFilenameMatchingPattern(String filename, String pattern)
 * 
 * A better name for the counter variable in the proof method could be patternPosition because you use the counter
 * for getting a char out of the pattern at a specific position. Same for i which could be filenamePosition.
 * Don't be afraid of using long method or variable names as long as they are descriptive.
 * 
 * STATUS: accepted (ok)

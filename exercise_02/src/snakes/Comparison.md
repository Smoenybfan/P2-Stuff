#Comparison

This comparison is between testing with <b>Mocktio</b> or with the created
class <b>MockedDie</b>.

In my opinion, the both approaches feel almost the same. With both you can say which methods
should work (or exists) and what they should return. I prefer the approach with Mocktio,
because over all you simply have more possibilities without writing too much code by your own.
